The Python Picamera module is currently not compatible with the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS (called **Bullseye**). 

Right now we are upgrading the Picamera module to make it work with the Bullseye version of Raspberry Pi OS.

If you want to use the Python Picamera module in the meantime, we suggest that you continue to use the previous version of Raspberry Pi OS (called **Buster**). [You can download an image of Buster here](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_armhf/images/raspios_armhf-2021-05-28/2021-05-07-raspios-buster-armhf.zip).

Once you've downloaded Buster, use the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) to write it to a microSD card.

Insert the microSD card into your computer, and load the Raspberry Pi Imager, use the Operating System menu, to select **Use custom**, and then select the **Buster** image.
